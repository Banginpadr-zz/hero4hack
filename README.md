#GoPro HERO4 Hacks

Since the HERO4 lineup does not execute autoexec.ash anymore, new methods have been created/discovered.
##Hero4 Black/Silver
Hero4 Black and Silver uses a modified firmware by Alti Force which enables the execution of a file called override.sh in the / of SD card.

####Get the modded firmware

The GoPro HERO4 camera (Black/Silver) does not support autoexec.ash hacks like the older generations, so a custom patch must be applied to the HERO4 firmware in order for override.sh program to be executed at the start, this was done by @evilwombat, [grab the firmware patch installer here](http://www.altiforce.net/support/)

####So, what can be done?

Like in autoexechack, here there are hacks that aim to extend the funtionality of the HERO4 cameras.

####What commands are available?

The GoPro HERO4 firmware has a file called gpsend that calls a HERO2/H3/H3+ WiFi command when executed with the right parameter. á¸¦ere is a list of H2/H3/H3+ commands: https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack/blob/master/HERO3/WifiCommands.md

The file gpsend is in /usr/local/gopro/bin/

Also, since the override.sh is executing from the Linux side you can use busybox [as explained here](http://goprouser.freeforums.org/autoexec-ash-in-v3-0-0-possible-t22731.html#p120687) and many more Linux commands.

#####Examples:

Working on HERO4 Black with v3.00 GP Firmware

* bp = BACPAC
* ca = CAMERA

---

| SH command                           | Meaning                   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca CM%00 | Video mode                |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca CM%01 | Photo mode                |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca CM%02 | MultiShot mode            |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend bp SH%01 | Trigger (record/take pic) |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend bp SH%00 | Stop recording            |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca WB%00 | White Balance Auto        |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca WB%01 | White Balance 3000k       |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca WB%02 | White Balance 5500k       |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca WB%03 | White Balance 6500k       |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca PT%01 | Protune ON                |
| /usr/local/gopro/bin/gpsend ca PT%00 | Protune OFF               |

####How to

First, install the custom firmware.

Then, make a file in the root of the SD card named **override.sh**, then put your code there.

It will be executed when the camera turns on.

####Misc notes

* /tmp/fuse_d/ = SD card
* /tmp/fuse_b/ = internal camera storage

##Hero4 Session

The HERO4 Session uses a native calibration tool that comes in the official stock GoPro firmware release, this set of tools can be accessed via cal.txt in the root of the SD card, Hypoxic did some research which you can find here: http://github.com/hypoxic/hero4-session

The cal.txt works on the latest Firmware (2.00)

####Commands available:

* _tapp (t app)
* _tcal (t cal)
* _buzz
